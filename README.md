# Bingo Plugin for RuneLite

A RuneLite plugin that integrates with the **clan.bingo** website to provide real-time OSRS Bingo gameplay with team collaboration features.

## üéØ What is Bingo?

OSRS Bingo is a competitive game mode where players race to complete objectives arranged in a grid format. Players can compete individually or in teams to achieve lines, patterns, or full board completion.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Automatic RSN Detection**: No need to manually enter your username - the plugin detects it when you're logged into OSRS
- **Secure Token Authentication**: Link your RuneLite client to your clan.bingo account using website-generated tokens
- **Real-time Board Sync**: Your bingo board and progress sync automatically between the plugin and website
- **Team Collaboration**: View team member progress and coordinate strategies
- **Progress Tracking**: Automatic detection of completed objectives based on your in-game actions
- **Cross-platform**: Works seamlessly with the clan.bingo web interface

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Installation

1. Download the latest plugin JAR from the releases page
2. Place it in your RuneLite plugins folder
3. Restart RuneLite
4. The Bingo plugin will appear in your plugin list

### 2. Authentication Setup

1. **Create Account**: Visit [clan.bingo](https://clan.bingo) and create an account
2. **Generate Token**: 
   - Log into your clan.bingo account
   - Navigate to "Plugin Integration" or "Generate Token"
   - Click "Generate New Token"
   - Copy the generated token (64-character string)
3. **Link Plugin**:
   - Launch OSRS and log into your account
   - Open the Bingo plugin panel (blue "B" icon in RuneLite sidebar)
   - Paste your token into the "Authentication Token" field
   - Click "Link Account"

### 3. Start Playing

Once authenticated, the plugin will:
- Automatically download your active bingo board
- Sync your team information
- Track objective completion in real-time
- Update your progress on the website

## üîß How It Works

### Authentication Flow

```
1. User creates account on clan.bingo website
2. User generates authentication token on website
3. User enters token in RuneLite plugin
4. Plugin validates token with clan.bingo API
5. Token is linked to user's RSN (auto-detected)
6. Plugin downloads board and team data
7. Real-time sync begins
```

### Data Synchronization

The plugin maintains a persistent connection with the clan.bingo servers to:
- **Download**: Bingo boards, team rosters, current objectives
- **Upload**: Completed objectives, progress updates, location data
- **Real-time**: Team member progress, chat messages, strategy updates

## üåê Website Integration

### clan.bingo Website Features

- **Board Creation**: Create custom bingo boards with various objective types
- **Team Management**: Form teams, invite players, manage permissions
- **Live Tracking**: Real-time view of all team member progress
- **Statistics**: Detailed analytics and completion history
- **Leaderboards**: Competition rankings and achievements

### API Endpoints Used

The plugin communicates with these clan.bingo API endpoints:
- `POST /api/authenticate-token` - Token validation and account linking
- `GET /api/board/{id}` - Download bingo board data
- `GET /api/team/{id}` - Fetch team information
- `POST /api/progress` - Upload objective completion
- `WebSocket /ws/live` - Real-time updates

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Token Security
- **Unique Tokens**: Each token is cryptographically generated (256-bit entropy)
- **Expiration**: Tokens expire after 24-48 hours
- **Single Use**: Tokens can only be linked to one RSN
- **Revocation**: Tokens can be revoked instantly from the website

### Data Protection
- **Minimal Data**: Only necessary game data is transmitted
- **Encryption**: All communication uses HTTPS/WSS
- **Local Storage**: Sensitive data is stored securely in RuneLite config
- **No Passwords**: Plugin never handles your clan.bingo password
